# BoxMind Frontend

This repository contains a minimal Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend implementing a neumorphism design. Components use Framer Motion and GSAP for small animations and React Hook Form with Zod for validation.

## Development

Node modules are not included in this environment. After cloning, install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app uses the Next.js App Router with basic pages for Home, Box Detail, and Reminders.
